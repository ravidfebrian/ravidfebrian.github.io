My expertise extends to visualizing complex automation systems with WinCC and NICOS 2.0, enabling me to design, develop, and optimize cutting-edge industrial control solutions with precision and efficiency. In addition, I have deepened my technical skill set as a research assistant in IT infrastructure, network engineering, and IoT projects. My strong organizational and communication abilities were further honed as chairperson of the KIA-Indonesian Community Aachen, where I led collaborative initiatives and managed diverse projects. I am confident that my unique blend of technical proficiency and leadership skills will make me a valuable asset to your team.",
