Hi! I'm Ravid. I'm a graduate student of electrical engineering with the specialization of automation engineering at FH Aachen. Also, I'm an open- and free-source enthusiast. 

This website is my personal website to share my professional experiences and hobby related topics, like tinkering with new techs. You can check out my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravid-f-ramadhan/) and [Github](https://github.com/ravidfebrian) page.
