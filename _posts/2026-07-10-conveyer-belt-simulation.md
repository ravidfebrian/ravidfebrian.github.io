- Why I did this project? Motivation
  Learn about industrial communication through free and open-source simulation
- Mention Codesys, Open Industry Project and OPC-UA. What are they?
- How the architecture looks like. Use draw.io diagram, which are OPC-UA server/client. What is being simulated? (PLC-Sim, Sensors, Actuators, etc.)
- What kind of simulation? Conveyer belt simulation. Include video.
- Challenges. sparse documentation from Open Industry Project for someone who hasn't touch godot like me.
- Conclusion. Know how the industrial communication and sensors in industry. For next, add production line like the one in sorting plant in package delivery. Also, add SCADA monitoring system as a control panel.
